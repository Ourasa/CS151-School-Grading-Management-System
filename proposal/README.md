**Project Title**: School Grading Management System

**Project Team #5**: Steven Pham, Nir Guberman, Cami Hawkins

**Proposal made by**: Steven Pham

**Problem/Issue to resolve**: 
Schools need a gradebook(s) in order to keep track of the performance of each student. However, doing this on paper not only takes a lot of time, but is prone to error due to human mistakes, especially when calculating the final grades. Students are also unable to keep track of their current grades, as direct access to the gradebook may lead them to alter results. 

**Assumptions**: Upon creation and start of the system, a default admin user will be entered into the system. This user will be used in order to add all other users into the system. All registered users/individuals within the system will have a first name, last name, password and a unique ID number. This program is to be made almost solely via Java. 

**Operating environments**: The program will run in a Java Virtual Machine, meaning all operating systems capable of obtaining and using a JVM can run this. 

**Intended Usage**: This system is intended to be used by schools. 

**High-level Description of solution**: 
We are developing a system that will replace paper gradebooks. Professors can add assignments and detail how many points each student obtained. In this system, all registered users (admins, professors, students) will be able to interact with the gradebook, with certain restrictions placed depending on the type of user. Users will have to login with their ID and password before being able to interact with the system. Those who cannot login are effectively locked out of the program entirely.

The plan is to start with the development of smaller components, such as the classes for each type of user, and the courses + assignments. These components will be used to complete the main functions of the system in a separate, overarching class. Edits can be made to the components as needed. The main functions are to be developed in parallel with the GUI. This is to ensure that the GUI and backend are able to properly communicate with each other. 

**Functionality**:
The system will tackle the issue of paper gradebooks by streamlining the grading process by allowing the computer to take care of a majority of the calculations for updating a grade. Professors will only need to input how many points an assignment is out of, and how many points each student obtained for the assignment. From here, the system will take over and use those inputs to update each studentâ€™s grades. 
Furthermore, students will now be able to login and view their grades without having the ability to alter them. Students may also choose to print their transcript. 

**Operations for Users**:
  
  Students: 
  - Can view GPA, and current/past grades of the courses they have taken.
  - Can print a transcript detailing their course history and grades. 


  Professors: 
  - Can add/remove/grade assignments of students in the classes they are responsible for.
  - Can add or remove students from the class. Removal of a student will not delete the student from the system. 
  - Can view their students and their grades in a course they are responsible for.


  Admins: 
  - Can add or remove students from the class. Removal of a student will not delete the student from the system. 
  - Can add new courses into the system. 
  - Can add new professors and new students into the system.
  - Can assign or remove a professor to/from a course.
  - Can remove professors and students from the system. 
  - Can remove courses from the system. 
  - Can view all Users and their information, including passwords.
  - Can save the state of the system into a txt file.
  - Can load a txt file to restore system to a former state.
